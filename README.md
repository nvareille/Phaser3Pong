# PHASER 3 Pong

## Context of the project

This projet was made by me (Nicolas VAREILLE), Professor in the Normandie Web School [School Link](https://normandiewebschool.fr/)

It was made for a Class where students needed to learn a new Framework quickly. And the fun part was that the teacher had to learn the Framework too :)

Here is a simple pong game I made after learning how to use [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)

## How to play ?

- Player 1 can move his bar with Z and S keys
- Player 2 can move his bar with the UP and DOWN keys
- Press SPACE to start the game
